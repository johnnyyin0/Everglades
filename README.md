### Related Items and Comparison:
- The Related Items & Comparison module displays two sets of related products for the customer. The first set is a list of products that are internally determined to be related to the product currently being viewed. The second set is a custom-created list of products that the customer has grouped with the current product into an "outfit".

### Ratings and Reviews:
- The Ratings & Reviews module allows customers to view and submit reviews for the product they have selected. This component includes the ability to write new reviews, view reviews in a list, sort reviews, see rating and product breakdowns. All reviews are saved per product, and styles or variations of the product are not accounted for within the module.
